## [Java - JDK8 - private and static Methods in Interface](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/interfaces)

With the release of Java 8, interfaces now can include static methods.

Similar to a class, we can access static methods of an interface using its references. For example,

```
Polygon.staticMethod();
```

Also, interfaces support private methods with the release of Java 9. Now you can use **private methods** and **private static methods** in interfaces.

Since you cannot instantiate interfaces, private methods are used as helper methods that provide support to other methods in interfaces.
